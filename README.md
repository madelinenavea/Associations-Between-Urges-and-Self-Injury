## üîç Overview

The **urge** to engage in a self-injurious behavior is arguably the **strongest predictor** for **self-injurious behavior**s. However, little is known about the associations between specific characteristics of urges (intensity and frequency) and specific characteristics of self-injurious behaviors (frequency, duration, engagement). This project explores the relationship between characteristics of self-injurious urges (SIUs) and self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data collected in **real time** over 14 days. The project applies **generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)** to assess whether the **intensity and frequency** of SIUs are associated with daily engagement in, and characteristics of, SIBs.

## üìä Research Questions

- Are same-day **SIU intensity** and **SIU frequency** associated with the likelihood of engaging in a SIB?
- Are any SIU characteristics associated with **how long** or **how often** SIBs occur once initiated?
- What are the limitations of using subjective urge measures to infer behavioral patterns?

## üß† Data Description

- **Participants:** N = 124 individuals reporting ‚â•3 SIBs in the prior month
- **Duration of Study:** 14-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
- **Survey Frequency:** Daily (self-reported)
- **Data Points Collected:**
  - Predictors:
    - **SIU Intensity:** 0‚Äì100 scale (standardized)
    - **SIU Frequency:** Count per day (standardized)
  - Outcomes:
    - **SIB Engagement:** Binary (Yes/No)
    - **SIB Frequency:** Daily count
    - **SIB Duration:** Minutes

## üîç Methods

- **Model Type:** Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs)
- **Fixed Effects:** SIU intensity, SIU frequency (standardized)
- **Random Effects:** Participant ID
- **Dependent Variables:**
  - SIB Engagement (binary logistic)
  - SIB Frequency (Poisson/negative binomial)
  - SIB Duration (continuous or log-normal, exploratory)

### R Packages Used

- `tidyverse`, `magrittr` for data wrangling  
- `lme4`, `modelsummary` for GLMMs  
- `ggplot2`, `wesanderson` for visualization

## üìà Key Results

- **SIU Intensity** and **SIB engagement**:  
  - OR = 7.36, 95% CI [3.73, 14.50]  
- **SIU Frequency** and **SIB engagement**:  
  - OR = 9.31, 95% CI [4.40, 19.69]  
- **No significant association** between SIU variables and either:
  - **SIB duration**
  - **SIB frequency**

These findings suggest that while **urge characteristics predict SIB engagement**, they may not reliably inform about **behavioral severity** like the amount of times you engage in a behavior or for how long. This is possibly due to its habitual nature or differing subjective thresholds for relief.

## üí° Future Directions

- Apply **time-series or hierarchical Bayesian models** to explore individual variability over time
- Incorporate **affective state** or **interoceptive awareness** data for multivariate prediction
- Develop **risk scoring systems** for real-time alerts in mobile health (mHealth) applications
- Explore **causal modeling** using Granger causality or dynamic structural models
